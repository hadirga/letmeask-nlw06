# LetMeAsk app

The app was developed during the NLW#06 offered by the RocketSeat team.

## Development

The app was developed using React running in a Docker container.

yarn create-react-app letmeask --template typescript

yarn add firebase
```

Set the firebase data as local environment variables creating a `.env.local` file.

To apply styles use plane CSS or SASS `yarn add node-sass@^5.0.0`

To navigate between the different pages use the React Router Dom `yarn add react-router-dom` and the types with development dependence `yarn add @types/react-router-dom -D`
